# Web Dashboard

Personal dashboard

Working so far:

- Hijri date calculation using estimated month start dates (intended for non Umm al-Qura based hijri calendar such as for local sighting) and served as an API
- Namaaz (Salah) Times retrieved from the Aladhan API and selected and re-served as an API
- Qiblah (Prayer direction) retrieved from Aladhan API and re-served
- Dashboard (on port 3000 by default) displaying time, gregorian, solar hijri, and hijri dates along with widgets
- Namaaz times widget
- Weather widget
- Qiblah widget
- Quick links widget
- Todo list (synced to a Notion database)
- Markdown notes editor (/pages.html)
