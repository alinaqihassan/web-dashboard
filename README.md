# Web Dashboard

Personal dashboard type thing

Working so far:

- Hijri date calculation using estimated month start dates (intended for non Umm al-Qura based hijri calendar such as for local sighting) and served as an API
- Namaaz (Salah) Times retrieved from the Aladhan API and selected and re-served as an API
